\section{Project Drivers}
This document was written using the Volere template.

\subsection{The Purpose of the Project }
\subsubsection{The User Business or Background of the Project Effort}
17 HIV Antiretroviral (ARV) medications have been approved for use in children. This results in various regimens available for use, as usually most children need to be on 3 medications at once. There are many factors to consider when initiating ARVs in children as many medications have different toxicities and side effects (including affecting growth, hormones, kidneys etc). Also, certain viruses may be resistant to some medications and not others. Some medications will interact with other HIV or non HIV medications. Some medications come in liquids, dissolvable tablets, or pills which can affect what age children can take them or not. Also, FDA approval for certain medications depends on: age, weight etc. Drug insurance will only cover some medications. Therefore, it is very challenging to decide on a regimen given the multiple permutations.
\subsubsection{Goals of the Project}
By creating a solution for this regimen issue, we can: improve efficiency, reduce human error, and provide an optimal and detailed regimen when medical teams need to decide on prescriptions for HIV patients. Creating this app will also help lessen the time that a doctor needs to use in order to come up with a medication regimen for a child. The doctor will be able to use the saved time for other important tasks and the patient will also receive their prescription at a sooner time.

\subsection{The Client, the Customer, and Other Stakeholders}
\subsubsection{The Client}
The client for this project is Dr. Sarah Khan. She is an assistant professor currently teaching at McMaster University. She is the individual who proposed the project to the team. She will be the one to test the product and give advice on improvements.
\subsubsection{The Customer}
The software application is being designed for doctors treating patients with HIV. The software will be used by users with all skill levels and deliver crucial information to them. Therefore, the application should be simple and fast.
\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
The other stakeholders involved with the development of this project are: Dr. Sarah Khan and Dr. Wenbo He. Dr. Khan will be our external supervisor and will be aiding the team with the design of the UI along with the crucial information that is to be implemented in the software.

\section{Functional Requirements}
\setcounter{subsection}{6}
\subsection{The Scope of the Work}
\subsubsection{The Current Situation}
There are many factors for medical teams to consider when they are initiating ARVs in children. Every kind of medication has different side effects and toxicities. Some medications may not be efficient to certain viruses because those viruses are resistant. The state of medications (gas,liquid, or solid) is one of the factors that medical teams need to consider, which can affect the age that children can take them. The medical teams need to compose different groups of medications depending on each patient’s conditions. Therefore, it is very challenging to decide on a regimen given the multiple permutations. There are the other important tasks for medical teams, so they cannot be on service all the time. In some emergency cases, the patient needs to receive their prescription at a sooner time.
\\We intend to build one application that can be functional  by smartphone. The medical teams can receive the patient’s personal information and enter the medications as they need in other place, to help lessen the time that medical teams need to use in order to come up with a medication regimen for a child. Also, the medical teams can see the type and the amount of medications in hospital from database, so they can be able to compose the feasible medications, to provide an optimal and detailed regimen when medical teams need to decide on prescriptions for HIV patients.

\section{Project Issues}
\setcounter{subsection}{17}
\subsection{Open Issues}
\begin{itemize}
\item Creating the android application will be difficult as everyone is unfamiliar with the language and environment of Android Studio.
\item The government constantly updates the list of approved medication for child use. Currently, we do not have a solution for updating our application to correspond with that list on a regular basis. Our implementation will include the most updated list at the time of release.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions }
Currently, our medication regimen application seems to be the only off-the-shelf solution for our client. There does not exist any solution outside of manual sorting/organizing to help filter out medication constraints for the HIV patients and provide them with the ideal dosage and schedule.

\subsection{New Problems }
We aim to have our application completely stand-alone while referencing medical information provided publicly by the government. The application should not interfere with any operations in hospitals.

\subsection{Tasks}
\begin{itemize}
\item Revise requirements document.
\item Create a test plan.
\item Demonstrate a proof of concept.
\item Draw up design documents.
\item Revision 0 project demonstration.
\item Create a user guide for the project.
\item Write up a test report.
\item Final revision project demonstration.
\item Write final revisions to documentation.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Migration to the New Product }
N/A

\subsection{Risks}
\begin{itemize}
\item If the algorithm is not carefully implemented, it might generate faulty regimens that doctors may overlook and suggest to patients. This could lead to serious consequences.
\item User passwords might be cracked even under reinforced encryption methods. The affected victims may blame the development team for not creating a secure system.
\item There will be no way to access the database with existing application credentials if the user forgets the application password.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Costs}
There are no direct monetary costs associated with this project, but about half a year of development time will be required.

\subsection{User Documentation and Training}
Users will be provided with information on the program use via a “Help” option which, when selected, will open a dialog box detailing general functionality of the program along with an FAQ section. Beyond the help document, a user’s familiarity with casual computer use should require no further training.

\subsection{Waiting Room}
\begin{itemize}
\item Currently, there are no plans on making a web-based version of the android application. However, this is something to consider upon future releases of our product.
\item Medical information is planned to be implemented statically. Dynamic implementation can be considered for keeping the information up-to-date  and automated by our clients.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Ideas for Solutions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Main programming language should be Java and coded inside Android Studio
\end{itemize}
